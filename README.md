## Setting Up

#### Tool Dependencies

- Git Clone this repository
- Have MongoDB running locally (we recommend homebrew) or through Docker

#### Editor Setup

This project uses Typescript, ESLint and Prettier. You should ensure you have your editor, or git hooks setup to run these tools automatically. PRs will not be merged if there are compiler, or lint errors. 

We recommend using VSCode as it has very good Typescript support.

1. Run the tests, local server, or typescript compiler using the relevant yarn command.

``NODE_ENV=
